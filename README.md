A simple Google Apps script to convert a properly formatted Google Drive Document to the markdown (.md) format. 

## Usage

  * Adding this script to your doc (once per doc):
    * Open your Google Drive document (http://drive.google.com)
    * Tools -> Script Editor
    * Clear the myFunction() default empty function and paste the contents of [converttomarkdown.gapps](https://raw.github.com/metadaddy/gdocs2md/master/converttomarkdown.gapps) into the code editor
    * File -> Save
    
  * Running the script (run as many times as you want):
    - Tools > Script Editor
    - Select "ConvertToMarkdown" function.
    - Click Run button (First run will require you to authorize it. Authorize and run again)
    - Converted doc with images attached will be emailed to you. Subject will be "[MARKDOWN_MAKER]...". In Gmail, 'Download all attachments' to get the doc and images in one zip.

## Interpreted formats
  * Text:
    * Paragraphs are separated by two newlines
    * Text styled as heading 1, 2, 3, etc is converted to Markdown heading: #, ##, ###, etc
    * Text formatted with Courier New is backquoted: `` `text` ``
    * Links in regular text are converted to MD format: `[anchortext](url)`
  * Lists:
    * Numbered lists are converted correctly, including nested lists
    * Bulleted lists are converted to "`*`" Markdown format appropriately, including nested lists
  * Images:
    * Images are correctly extracted and sent as attachments
  * Blocks:
    * Table of contents is replaced by `[[TOC]]`
    * Blocks of text delimited by "--- class whateverclassnameyouwant" and "---" are converted to `<div class="whateverclassnameyouwant"></div>` 
    * Source code: 
      * Blocks of text delimited by "--- source code" or "--- src" and "---" are converted to use GitHub-style triple-backticks ```` ``` ````
    * Tables:
      * **NEW**: Tables are converted to GitHub-style Markdown
  * "--- jsperf `<testID>`" is replaced by an iframe that shows an interactive chart of a JSPerf test. The `<testID>` is the last part of the URL of the Browserscope anchor in your JSPerf test. Something like `"agt1YS1wcm9maWxlcnINCxIEVGVzdBjlm_EQDA"` in the URL `http://www.browserscope.org/user/tests/table/agt1YS1wcm9maWxlcnINCxIEVGVzdBjlm_EQDA`
